Use objdump to look at structure of core dump. Can this identify sections of heap and stack? Can it further be narrowed to area?

Design possible search methods for data.
Straight search
Partial search
find in int 32 and 64 - consider endian
Patterns in a int array - eg low byte of every 4 bytes

Take diff dumps

Identify exact location of leak

First stages :

Write a sample broken program - do full string and partial string searches, stack and heap.

define red search strings

Find data within core dump - just as raw data

Create full test suite of example broken programs

Define program name + put on Google code or github 

Investigate:
- Objdump section output.  Use zero strip on sections
- Java core dump? Answer SO question.  Core dump with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/337793/can-i-force-generation-of-a-jvm-crash-log-file
